<h2> Introduction </h2>

<p>In this introductory notebook for VoyagerPy, we demonstrate basic exploratory data analysis of spatial
	transcriptomics
	data.
	Basic knowledge of Python is assumed. </p>

<p>We furthermore assume that <a href="https://scanpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/" class="link-primary">Scanpy</a> is
	installed. However, Scanpy
	is not a dependency for VoyagerPy.</p>
