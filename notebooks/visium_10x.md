## Introduction

In this introductory notebook for VoyagerPy, we demonstrate basic exploratory data analysis of spatial transcriptomics data.
Basic knowledge of Python is assumed.

We furthermore assume that [Scanpy](https://scanpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) is installed. However, Scanpy is not a dependency for VoyagerPy.
