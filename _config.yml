# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use

# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

  VoyagerPy is a Python package which aims to provide the same functionality 
  for the Python community as [Voyager](https://pachterlab.github.io/voyager) 
  does for the R community. We use [AnnData](https://anndata.rtfd.io) as our 
  data structure which should be familiar to some. The package provides plotting 
  functions useful for analysing spatial single-cell genomics data.
