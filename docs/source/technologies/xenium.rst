Xenium Processing Workflows with VoyagerPy
==========================================

The 10X Genomics Xenium platform is a microscopy based spatial profiling technology capable of detecting 
hundreds of gene targets at cellular resolution. The technology is compatible with both fresh frozen 
and formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue samples. Similar to other technologies that extend 
single molecule fluorescent in-situ hybridization (smFISH), Xenium increases multiplexing capabilities 
by barcoding genes over multiple rounds of imaging and probe hybridization. In contrast those technologies, 
circular DNA readout probes are amplified and fluorescently tagged after ligation of a detection probe. 
The amplification step greatly increases signal-to-noise ratio and improves imaging efficiency.
