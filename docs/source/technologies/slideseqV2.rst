Slide-seqV2 Processing Workflows with VoyagerPy
===============================================

The Slide-seqV2 platform enables transcriptome-wide spatial profiling of fresh-frozen tissue sections. 
In both Slide-seqV2 and its predecessor, Slide-seq, mRNA capture takes place on a DNA-barcoded array of 
10ùúáùëö beads immobilized on a microscopy slide. Slide-seqV2 offers improvements in capture efficiency 
and enzymatic library generation.
