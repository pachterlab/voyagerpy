PhenoCycler Processing Workflows with VoyagerPy
===============================================

The commercially available `PhenoCycler Solution <https://www.akoyabio.com/phenocycler/>`_ 
by Akoya Biosciences relies on Co-Detection by Indexing (CODEX), a technique enables highly multiplexed 
single-cell quantification of membrane protein expression in fresh-frozed or formalin fixed paraffin 
embedded (FFPE) tissues. In CODEX, antigens are stained simultaneously with unique oligonucleotide-conjugated 
antibodies. Antibody binding events are visualized iteratively via successive rounds of fluorescent 
microscopy. At each imaging round, cells are exposed to a mix of two non-fluorescent index nucleotides 
and two fluorescent labeling nucleotides. The DNA barcodes are designed such that only two antibodies 
can be labeled in a single imaging cycle, and only if the indexing nucleotide has been incorporated. 
Notably, CODEX completes a 30-antibody visualization in approximately 3.5 hours and is adaptable to 
most standard three-color fluorescence microscope platforms.

Download Data and Preprocessing
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Several CODEX datasets were generated by the HuBMAP Consortium and are available for download from their
`data portal <https://portal.hubmapconsortium.org/>`_. Raw and processed data are typically avaiable 
for several fields of view.
