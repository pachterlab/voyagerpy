MERFISH Processing Workflows with Voyager
=========================================

The MERSCOPE Platform from `Vizgen <https://vizgen.com/products/>`_ is enabled by Multiplexed Error-Robust 
Fluorescence in-situ Hybridization (MERFISH). MERFISH is a spatial transcriptomics technology that expands 
the multiplexing capabilities of single molecule fluorescent in-situ hybridization (smFISH) via a 
combinatorial barcode coupled with sequential rounds of imaging. The technology enables detection of 
hundreds to thousands of single molecule targets at sub-cellular resolution. While MERFISH was designed 
to be compatible with fresh or fixed frozen tissues, Vizgen has demonstrated efficacy of the technology 
on FFPE tissue specimens.
