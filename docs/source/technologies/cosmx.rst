CosMX Processing Workflows with VoyagerPy
=========================================

The Nanostring CosMX Spatial Molecular Imager (SMI) enables spatial profiling of RNA and proteins at 
cellular or subcellular resolution with formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) or fresh frozen tissue 
samples. The CosMX technology extends single molecule fluorescent in-situ hybridization (smFISH) by 
coupling detection probes to a 60-80 nucleotide DNA readout domain. The readout domain contains 4 
consecutive regions that hybridize to unique reporters that are read out over sequential imaging 
rounds. CosMX increases detection efficiency by targeting different regions of the RNA target with up 
to 5 detection probes, each coupled to the same readout domain. The photocleavable sites in the 
reporters enable fast fluorescent signal quenching and greatly increase the signal-to-noise ratio.
